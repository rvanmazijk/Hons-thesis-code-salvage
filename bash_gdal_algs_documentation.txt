Aim: to convert NASA's MODIS `.hdf` (release 4) (= "HDF4") files into `.tif`s.

Attempt 1:
Using `gdalUtils` pkg in `R`, namely `gdal_translate()`.
--> That failed...

Attempt 2:
Using `gdal_translate` fn in `bash`, after `brew`-ing `gdal`, `gdalUtils`, and trying to
coerce it to install HDF4 drivers (e.g. `$ brew install gdal --options-with hdf4;`).
--> Failed also...

Conclusion:
Neither `R` nor `bash` are able to acces the installation of GDAL that has the HDF4
drivers I need... but QGIS /can/, as evident by its ability to open and display MODIS
`.hdf`s with no problems (sub-datasets and bands even!). So clearly the information
needed to interpret `.hdf`s does exist /somewhere/ on my laptop... but where?

Solution:
Navigation in QGIS to the algorithms toolbox allows me to see the directory for the
`gdal_translate` and `gdalinfo` executables it uses (the ones that work with `.hdf`s!).
And these directories evaluate in `bash` to the execs themselves.

Implementation in R:
Using the `base` funtion `system()` to run a character string as a `bash` command, I
can use the QGIS GDAL execs!

Let's try to run `$ gdalinfo ~/foo_folder/foo.hdf;` but with `gdalinfo` replaced with the
QGIS GDAL version:

```{r}
gdalinfo <- "Library/foo/QGIS/GDAL/foo/foo/gdalinfo " # space NB!!!!
system(
  paste0(
    gdalinfo, "~/foo_folder/foo.hdf"
  )
)
```

And then adding safety quotes around dir names (to cope with my HDD having a quote and a
space in it... which `bash` can't handle!!!) (such that the quotes appear in `bash`,
not `R`... so it's sort of markup-y here in `R`):

```{r}
gdalinfo <- "Library/foo/QGIS/GDAL/foo/foo/gdalinfo "
system(
  paste0(
    gdalinfo, "\"", ~/foo_folder/foo.hdf", "\""
  )
)
```

C00l! Works great! See the `.R`-scripts for how to use "gdal_translate" like this
(basically exactly the same, but with the "HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:" and band syntax).

# Setup ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here, I load all the setup info and my own defined functions (in `11_my_funs.R`),
# and all the saved objects (mostly rasters) (in `12_my_objs.R`).

rm(list = ls())
source("i_my_funs.R")
source("ii_my_objs.R")

# Applying `resample()` -----------------------------------------------------------------

# 2017-05-08 15:59 ---

#   After my meeting with Tony today, he agrees that `aggregate()` is
#   better, as the mean-style way of doing things is more intuitive.

#   And this preserves the pixel/grid-cell structure-alignment, whereas `resample()`-ed
#   pixels are not necessarily aligned with the input raster's pixels.

#   Though, this function may come in hand if I have to force some other raster, say
#   MODIS, to be a specific starting resolution (say 0.05 deg) if it comes from NASA in,
#   say, 0.06 deg resolution, in order to then use `aggregate()` on it with its pixels
#   aligned with those of all my other environmental vars.

ress <- seq(0.05, 1.00, by = 0.05) # as before
resampled_MAP_GCFR <- custom_resample_loop(MAP_GCFR_0.05, ress)

par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot_raster_list(resampled_MAP_GCFR)
par(op)

resampled_MAP_GCFR_vals <- as_df_raster_vals_list(resampled_MAP_GCFR, n = ress)

# Applying roughness calc and then `aggregate()` ----------------------------------------

# 2017-05-08 --- In pseudo-`R`-code:

# (See Fig. 1b in my notes from my meeting with Tony (2017-05-08), which I had *after*
# I wrote this script)

# 2017-05-09 --- Refactored this ยง of code today
